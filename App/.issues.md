# Tracking issues for my project

## General

## Backend

### SocketIO
1. create database for rooms
2. Figure out why clients in album room aren't getting emits after page reload. 

## Frontend

### Field state
I am trying to use a slice to save custom fields from another user to update current user's album. 
- Using SocketIO to communicate between server and client. 
- Listener named 'CustomFieldUpdateListener' listens for emits and takes action
  - creates toast notification letting currentUser know another user added a customField to an album currentUser also owns. 
  - toast asks user if they want to update their album with those custom fields. clicking the toast navigates user to the Album page and fills in addCustomField text boxes allowing user to submit to add to their album metadata. 

Files being used: 
1. CustomFieldUpdateListener
2. AlbumDetails
3. CustomFieldForm

### CustomFieldUpdateListener
#### Todos: 
1. close toast
2. open toast logic
3. update toastProps once working
4. remove unnessecary console logs


### AlbumDetails.jsx

#### Todos: 
1. fix selector/state logic for customFields
2. Clicking addCustomField and EditFields buttons are broken. 

### CollectionSlice

#### Todos: 
1. extract custom fields from album item and make separate object. 
2. create error helper function for DRYness
